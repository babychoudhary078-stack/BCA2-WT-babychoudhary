## How Each Lecture File Is Structured

Every file in the `2-Content/` folder follows the same pattern:

```
# Lecture Title
├── Learning Objectives         ← What you'll learn
├── Theory Section              ← Explanations with analogies and diagrams
│   ├── Sub-topic 1
│   ├── Sub-topic 2
│   └── Code examples
├── Practical Session           ← Lab experiment with full code
│   ├── Instructions
│   └── Complete working code
├── Summary Table               ← Quick reference
└── Self-Assessment Questions   ← Test your understanding
```

## How to Navigate the Course

### If You're Following the Schedule
1. Check [Lecture-Plan.md](../../../Lecture-Plan.md) for today's topic
2. Open the corresponding file in the topic folder (e.g., `1-Internet-Technology/`, `2-HTML-Fundamentals/`)
3. Read the theory, then try the practical exercise

### If You Want to Jump to a Topic
1. Look at the folder names in `2-Content/` — they are numbered by unit
2. Each file inside is numbered sequentially (01, 02, 03...)
3. Open the file for the topic you want

### If You're Preparing for Exams
1. Check [1-Curriculum/25BCA060T_Web_Technology.md](../../../1-Curriculum/25BCA060T_Web_Technology.md) for exact exam syllabus
2. Read the **Summary Tables** at the end of each lecture file
3. Answer the **Self-Assessment Questions** in each file
